    -- HELPER: find the customer behind a phone number.
-- Network usage, invoices and partner usage only know the (hashed) phone number, not the customer id.
-- If two customers share one phone number (a duplicate in the CRM), we pick the one with the lowest customer_id,
-- so every phone number points to exactly ONE customer and the facts never get duplicate rows.
-- The FIRST version of each customer is valid from 1900-01-01 here (not from created_at): invoices, payments and
-- partner usage can be older than the CRM record (e.g. July invoices for a customer created in September), and
-- they must still find their customer. Later versions keep their real dates, so history lookups are unchanged.
